# Sprout - Momentum 2021

This is a group project created by [Bryson Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-miller-4b47701b1/), [Favour Oladimeji-Nelson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/favour-o/), [David Morgan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-morgan-43a59718b/), and [Mauricio Darcourt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauricio-d-5115a6172/) for the MIT 2021 Capital One Momentum challenge. 

For this project we were tasked with making a tool to help enable financial resiliency for small businesses. Our team developed Sprout, a professional skills networking website where vendors can sell modularized lesson content and services to customers.
